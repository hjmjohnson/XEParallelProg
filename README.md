FILES NOT IN THIS ZIP FILE
Chapter 10 uses the NQueens example program that ships with Advisor. You can find the nqueens_Advisor.zip file in the Samples\<locale> folder in the Parallel Studio 2011 install folder, usually C:\Program Files\Intel\Parallel Studio 2011. There is no example available for Linux.

Chapter 11 uses the Tachyon ray tracing example that is shipped with Parallel Studion XE.
On Windows it's usually located at <Parallel Studio XE Installation directory>\Samples\en_US\C++\tachyon_compiler.zip).
Under Linux, the usual location is /opt/intel/composerxe/Samples/en_US/C++/tachyon.tar.gz


The location of both these files may vary depending on which version of Parallel Studio you have installed, and what installation directories you chose.
